# Introduction
We present the cats.

Two cats that are the best. They were measured using a PCASP.

One of the cats seems to be a form of a black hole.
# Simulations

We simulate how the black hole of a cat swells light. 

# Methodology

We expose the black hole cat to the sun and embrace the darkness that he creates.
